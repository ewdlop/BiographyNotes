# how many time jesus and god is used in bible and what does tf-idf score typical says about this things?

### **Occurrences of "Jesus" and "God" in the Bible**
The number of times "Jesus" and "God" appear in the Bible varies slightly by translation, but typical counts are:

- **"God"**: Around **4,300** times in the King James Version (KJV)
- **"Jesus"**: Around **983** times in the KJV

### **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) Analysis**
TF-IDF is a statistical measure used in natural language processing to evaluate how important a word is in a document relative to a collection (or corpus) of documents. Here's what it typically tells us about words like "Jesus" and "God" in the Bible:

1. **High Term Frequency (TF)**  
   - Since "God" appears over 4,000 times and "Jesus" nearly 1,000 times, they have **high TF scores** in biblical texts.  
   - This suggests these terms are central to the overall narrative.

2. **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) Considerations**  
   - If we analyze the Bible as a single document, IDF would be low for these words because they appear so frequently, meaning they are common words within this specific text.  
   - However, if we compare different books of the Bible, "Jesus" would have **low IDF in the New Testament** (where He is frequently mentioned) but **high IDF in the Old Testament** (where He appears less often or prophetically).

3. **Contextual Insights from TF-IDF**  
   - A high **TF-IDF score** for "Jesus" in a particular book (e.g., Gospels) suggests that the book focuses significantly on Jesus.  
   - A lower **TF-IDF score** for "God" in some books may indicate a shift in theological themes or a focus on other divine attributes (e.g., "Lord," "Father").  
   - Comparing books with high "God" TF-IDF scores vs. those with high "Jesus" TF-IDF scores can highlight doctrinal emphases (e.g., the Old Testament vs. the Gospels).
